Run the following in your local "webroot" folder to start an http server on port 8887

	start server

Or

	python -m http.server 8887

Then view pages at:

[localhost:8887/](http://localhost:8887/)  
[localhost:8887/team](http://localhost:8887/team/)  
[localhost:8887/home](http://localhost:8887/home/)  
[localhost:8887/localsite](http://localhost:8887/comparison/)  
[localhost:8887/localsite](http://localhost:8887/localsite/)  
[localhost:8887/feed](http://localhost:8887/feed/)  


Also look at your code with an editor like VS Code.
